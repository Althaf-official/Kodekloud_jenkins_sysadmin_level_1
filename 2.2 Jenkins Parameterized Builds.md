A new DevOps Engineer has joined the team and he will be assigned some Jenkins related tasks. Before that, the team wanted to test a simple parameterized job to understand basic functionality of parameterized builds. He is given a simple parameterized job to build in Jenkins. Please find more details below:



Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321.


1. Create a parameterized job which should be named as parameterized-job


2. Add a string parameter named Stage; its default value should be Build.


3. Add a choice parameter named env; its choices should be Development, Staging and Production.


4. Configure job to execute a shell command, which should echo both parameter values (you are passing in the job).


5. Build the Jenkins job at least once with choice parameter value Production to make sure it passes.
------------

To accomplish the given tasks in Jenkins, you can follow these steps:

1. **Login to Jenkins:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the Jenkins UI by clicking on the Jenkins button in the top bar.
   - Login using the provided credentials (username: admin, password: Adm!n321).

2. **Create a Parameterized Job:**
   - Click on "New Item" in the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Enter "parameterized-job" as the item name and select "Freestyle project."
   - Click "OK" to create the job.

3. **Add a String Parameter:**
   - In the job configuration, scroll down to the "Build" section.
   - Click on the "This project is parameterized" checkbox.
   - Click on the "Add Parameter" dropdown and select "String Parameter."
   - Set the name to "Stage" and provide a default value, e.g., "Build."

4. **Add a Choice Parameter:**
   - Click on "Add Parameter" again and select "Choice Parameter."
   - Set the name to "env" and enter the choices: "Development," "Staging," "Production."

5. **Configure Shell Command:**
   - In the "Build" section, click on "Add build step" and select "Execute shell."
   - In the command box, enter the following shell command:
     ```bash
     echo "Stage: $Stage"
     echo "Environment: $env"
     ```

6. **Save the Configuration:**
   - Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Save" to save the job configuration.

7. **Build the Job:**
   - Now, you can manually trigger a build by clicking on "Build Now" in the Jenkins job dashboard.
   - When prompted, select "Staging" as the value for the "env" parameter.
   - Check the console output of the build to ensure that both parameter values are echoed correctly.

With these steps, you should have successfully created a parameterized Jenkins job named "parameterized-job" with string and choice parameters, and it should execute a shell command echoing the parameter values.
