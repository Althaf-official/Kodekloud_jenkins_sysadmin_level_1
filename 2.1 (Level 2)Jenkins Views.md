The DevOps team of xFusionCorp Industries is planning to create a number of Jenkins jobs for different tasks. So to easily manage the jobs within Jenkins UI they decided to create different views for all Jenkins jobs based on usage/nature of these jobs, - for example nautilus-crons view for all cron jobs. Based on the requirements shared below please perform the below mentioned task:



Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321.


1. Create a Jenkins job named nautilus-test-job.

2. Configure this job to run a simple bash command i.e echo "hello world!!".

3. Create a view named nautilus-crons (it must be a global view of type List View) and make sure nautilus-test-job and nautilus-cron-job (which is already present on Jenkins) jobs are listed under this new view.

4. Schedule this newly created job to build periodically at every minute i.e * * * * * (please make sure to use the cron expression exactly same how it is mentioned here)

5. Make sure the job builds successfully.


Note:

1. You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also, Jenkins UI sometimes gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end. In this case please make sure to refresh the UI page.

2. For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.

I can guide you through the steps to achieve the tasks you mentioned, but keep in mind that I can't interact with external systems or create actual jobs. You'll need administrative access to your Jenkins instance to perform these tasks. Please make sure to adapt the steps based on your Jenkins version and configuration.

1. **Create Jenkins Job:**
   - Open your Jenkins dashboard.
   - Click on "New Item" on the left sidebar.
   - Enter "nautilus-test-job" as the item name.
   - Select "Freestyle project" and click "OK."

2. **Configure Job to Run Bash Command:**
   - In the job configuration page, find the "Build" section.
   - Click on "Add build step" and select "Execute shell."
   - In the command box, enter: `echo "hello world!!"`
   - Save the configuration.

3. **Create a List View:**
   - On the Jenkins dashboard, click on the '+' icon to create a new view.
   - Choose "List View" as the view type.
   - Enter "nautilus-crons" as the name and click "OK."

4. **Add Jobs to the List View:**
   - On the new view page, click on "Add Job" and add both "nautilus-test-job" and "nautilus-cron-job."

5. **Schedule Job to Build Periodically:**
   - Go back to the configuration of "nautilus-test-job."
   - In the Build Triggers section, check the option "Build periodically."
   - Enter the cron expression `* * * * *` in the schedule box.
   - Save the configuration.

6. **Ensure the Job Builds Successfully:**
   - Trigger the job manually or wait for the next scheduled build.
   - Check the build status on the Jenkins dashboard. Ensure it is successful.

**Note:**
   - Depending on your Jenkins version, the UI might differ slightly.
   - Make sure you have the necessary plugins installed, and if prompted, restart Jenkins.
   - If you face UI issues after Jenkins restart, refresh the page.

Remember to adapt these steps based on your Jenkins version and any specific configurations you might have. If you encounter any issues, refer to Jenkins documentation or seek assistance from your Jenkins administrator.
