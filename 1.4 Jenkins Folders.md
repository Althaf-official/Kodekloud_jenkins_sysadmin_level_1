# The DevOps team of xFusionCorp Industries is planning to create a number of Jenkins jobs for different tasks. To easily manage the jobs within Jenkins UI they decided to create different Folders for all Jenkins jobs based on usage/nature of these jobs. Based on the requirements shared below please perform the below mentioned task:



Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321.


1. There are already two jobs httpd-php and services.

2. Create a new folder called Apache under Jenkins UI.

3. Move the above mentioned two jobs under Apache folder.

Note:
1. You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also, Jenkins UI sometimes gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end. In this case, please make sure to refresh the UI page.

2. For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry for any confusion, but I'm a text-based AI and cannot directly interact with the Jenkins UI to perform these actions for you. However, I can guide you through the steps to achieve this using the Jenkins web interface. Please follow these steps:

1. Access the Jenkins UI:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Enter the URL of your Jenkins server in the address bar.
   - Log in using the provided username "admin" and password "Adm!n321".

2. Creating a New Folder:
   - After logging in, you should be on the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Look for the "New Item" or "New Task" link on the left-hand side of the dashboard. Click on it.
   - Enter a name for the new folder, e.g., "Apache."
   - Select "Folder" as the project type.
   - Click "OK" or "Save" to create the new folder.
  
If you're not seeing the option to create a new folder when clicking on "New Item," it's possible that the "Folders" plugin is not installed on your Jenkins instance. Folders in Jenkins are typically managed through plugins. You'll need to install the "CloudBees Folders" plugin or a similar plugin to create folders in Jenkins. Here's how you can do it:

1. Log in to your Jenkins instance as an administrator.

2. Click on "Manage Jenkins" on the left-hand side of the Jenkins dashboard.

3. In the "Manage Jenkins" menu, click on "Manage Plugins."

4. Navigate to the "Available" tab in the "Plugin Manager."

5. In the "Filter" box, type "CloudBees Folders" or "Folders," and search for the plugin.

6. Check the checkbox next to the "CloudBees Folders" (or similar) plugin to select it.

7. Click the "Install without restart" button to install the plugin.

8. Once the plugin is installed, you may need to restart Jenkins for the changes to take effect. You can do this by clicking on "Jenkins Home" at the top-left corner of the dashboard and then selecting "Restart" from the menu.

9. After the restart, you should be able to see the option to create a folder when you click on "New Item" or "New Task."

10. Follow the previous steps in my previous response to create a folder and move your jobs into it.

Please note that the exact name of the plugin and the process may vary depending on your Jenkins version, so adapt these steps as needed.








3. Moving Jobs to the Apache Folder:
   - Go back to the Jenkins dashboard.
   - You should see your existing jobs "httpd-php" and "services" on the dashboard.
   - To move them to the "Apache" folder:
     - Click on one of the jobs (e.g., "httpd-php") to go to its configuration page.
     - In the configuration page, look for an option to change the project name or location. It might be called "Job to Copy," "Name," or something similar.
     - Change the name or location to "Apache/httpd-php" (or "Apache/services" for the other job).
     - Save the configuration changes.

   - Repeat the above steps for the other job, so both "httpd-php" and "services" are moved to the "Apache" folder.

Now, your jobs should be organized within the "Apache" folder on your Jenkins dashboard. Please make sure to adapt the steps as needed based on your specific Jenkins version, as the UI may vary slightly between different versions of Jenkins.
