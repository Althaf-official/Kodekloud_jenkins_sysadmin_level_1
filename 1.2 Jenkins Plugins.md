# The Nautilus DevOps team has recently setup a Jenkins server, which they want to use for some CI/CD jobs. Before that they want to install some plugins which will be used in most of the jobs. Please find below more details about the task



Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and Adm!n321 password.


1. Once logged in, install Git and GitLab plugins. You might need to restart Jenkins service to install these plugins, so we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre.

Note:

1. Once you restart Jenkins service it will go down for some time so please wait for the Jenkins login page to come back before clicking on the Check button.

2. For these scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so you can share them with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using screen recording software like loom.com to record and share your work.

3. To install Git and GitLab plugins in Jenkins, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Jenkins server.

2. Click on "Manage Jenkins" in the Jenkins dashboard.

3. In the "Manage Jenkins" menu, select "Manage Plugins."

4. In the "Manage Plugins" page, go to the "Available" tab. Here, you can search for and install the Git and GitLab plugins.

5. In the "Filter" box, type "Git" to find the Git plugin. Check the checkbox next to the "Git plugin" to select it.

6. Similarly, in the "Filter" box, type "GitLab" to find the GitLab plugin. Check the checkbox next to the "GitLab plugin" to select it.

7. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and you'll see a button labeled "Install without restart." Click on it to start the installation of the selected plugins.

8. Wait for the installation to complete. Once it's done, you'll see a message indicating that the installation was successful.

9. After installing the plugins, it's recommended to restart the Jenkins service. To do this, click on the "Go back to the top page" link in the message at the top of the page.

10. Back on the Jenkins dashboard, you may see a message at the top that suggests restarting Jenkins. Click on "Manage Jenkins" again.

11. In the "Manage Jenkins" menu, select "Manage Nodes and Clouds."

12. On the "Nodes" page, you'll see a link on the left side that says "Quiet down." Click on it to start the process of shutting down Jenkins safely.

13. Once Jenkins has quieted down and no jobs are running, you'll see an option to "Restart Jenkins." Click on it to initiate the restart.

14. Jenkins will restart, and when it's back up, the Git and GitLab plugins will be installed and ready for use.

Please note that Jenkins may be unavailable during the restart process, so make sure to perform these actions during a maintenance window or when it won't disrupt ongoing development and builds.
