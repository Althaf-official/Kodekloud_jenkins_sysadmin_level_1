# Create a jenkins user named anita with LQfKeWWxWD password, their full name should be Anita (it is case sensitive).

2. Using Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy assign overall read permission to anita user.

3. Remember to remove all permissions for Anonymous users (if given) and make sure admin user has overall Administer permissions.

4. There is one existing job, make sure anita only has read permissions to that job (we are not worried about other permissions like Agent, SCM, etc.).



To achieve the tasks you described in Jenkins, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Jenkins User Named "Anita" with Password "LQfKeWWxWD":
   - Log in to your Jenkins instance with an account that has administrative privileges.
   - Click on "Manage Jenkins" in the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Click on "Manage Users" to manage user accounts.
   - Click on "Create User" to create a new user.
   - Fill in the user details:
     - Username: anita (case-sensitive)
     - Password: LQfKeWWxWD
     - Full Name: Anita
   - Click "Create User" to create the user.

2. Use Project-Based Matrix Authorization Strategy to Assign Overall Read Permission to Anita User:
   - Go to "Manage Jenkins" from the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Click on "Configure Global Security" under the "Security" section.
   - Under the "Authorization" section, select "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy."
   - Scroll down to the "Overall" section of the matrix.
   - Add "anita" to the "Read" column, and then save the configuration.

3. Remove All Permissions for Anonymous Users and Ensure Admin User Has Overall Administer Permissions:
   - In the same "Configure Global Security" page, locate the "Anonymous" user in the matrix.
   - Remove all permissions for the "Anonymous" user.
   - Make sure that the "admin" user has "Overall Administer" permission in the "Overall" section of the matrix.

4. Set Anita's Permissions for the Existing Job:
   - Go to the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Find the existing job for which you want to grant "Read" permission to Anita.
   - Click on the job to open its configuration.
   - Under the "Access Control for Builds" section, select "Project-based Matrix Authorization."
   - Add "anita" to the "Read" column for the job.
   - Save the job configuration.

Now, Anita should have "Overall Read" permission, while the "Anonymous" user has no permissions. Additionally, the "admin" user has "Overall Administer" permissions, and Anita only has "Read" permission for the specified job.
